The command line interface and terminal have always been daunting to me because I didn’t comprehend how to use them and instead relied on the GUI. Using the command line is fascinating because if you’re familiar, it can be very convenient and allows the user to make changes quicker than using GUI. I definitely expect to continue to use the GUI more often because I am more familiar with it and still find the CLI difficult to use. However, my goal is to reach a point where I’m very comfortable using the terminal to navigate and make changes.
